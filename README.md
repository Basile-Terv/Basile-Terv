I am a PhD student at Meta Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) Paris, jointly with INRIA Paris, supervised by Jean Ponce and Yann Le Cun.

I am interested in training Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) for representation learning and controlling physical agents.

I graduated in 2024 from the MVA masters (ENS Paris-Saclay) where I studied deep and statistical learning and had worked with a [research team from Mila](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05577) on materials discovery with GNNs.

Previously, I studied applied mathematics at Ecole Polytechnique, where I studied statistics, optimization, probability.
