I just finished my studies at MVA (ENS Paris-Saclay) where I studied deep and statistical learning.
During this year I worked with a [research team from Mila](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05577) on materials discovery with GNNs.
I am now interning at Facebook AI Research in the JEPA team.
Previously, I studied applied mathematics at Ecole Polytechnique and I am currently writing my second mathematics research article (stochastic calculus and probability theory).
